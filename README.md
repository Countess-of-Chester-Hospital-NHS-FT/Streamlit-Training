# Streamlit Training

### Status
This project is for training purposes. It is based heavily on material taught on the [HSMA](https://hsma.co.uk/hsma_content/modules/current_module_details/7_git_and_web_development.html).

### About the project
Contains 3 examples of streamlit web apps, a one page app, a multipage app and a simulation app.

Note: Only public or simulated data are shared in this repository

### Project Structure

There is one folder for each streamlit app

* basic - shows how to run a basic single page website
* basic multipage - shows how to arrange content into multiple pages
* simulation - takes the model from SimPy-1 and makes it into an app

In order to run each app, in the terminal move into the relevant folder (using cd foldername)
and use `streamlit run filename` (where filename is the page you want to run).

For more information on deploying apps to streamlit community cloud (providing they contain no personal data or sensitive info) see chapter of [HSMA book](https://webapps.hsma.co.uk/streamlit_community_cloud.html)
